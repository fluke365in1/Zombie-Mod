Valve Model, Valve Texture = No.
Valve Model, Custom Texture = No.
Custom Model, Valve Texture = No.
Custom Model, Custom Texture = Appears to be OK currently.


================
 SOURCE CODE
================

The source code is bundled in every release and patch. It's located in
addons/sourcemod/scripting/ and prepared to compile once the SDK Hooks include
file is installed.

Source code repositories with build scripts are available on our side at GitHub:

  * https://github.com/qubka/Zombie-Plague

================
 INSTALLATION
================

Install the following requirements:

* Metamod:Source 1.10.6+
  http://sourcemm.net/
  
* SourceMod 1.7.3+
  http://sourcemod.net/

The version numbers listed above are minimum requirements. You should always get
the latest stable version.

Note: Verify that both Metamod:Source and SourceMod is running before
      continuing. Type these commands in the server console: "meta version" and
      "sm version". If both give version information it's working. If not, go
      through their installation instructions again and verify that everything
      is in the correct place.

When the requirements are installed the Zombie Plague release package can be
extracted into the "csgo" folder and all files should go in the correct
place.

Start the dedicated server and verify that Zombie Plague is running by typing
this command in the server console: "zp_version".

Check the SourceMod error logs if it's not working. Zombie Plague will
validate and log errors if something is wrong. Look for messages from
zbm3_core.smx.
